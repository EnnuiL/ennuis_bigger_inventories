# About the mod's design

What, do you think I was just a supervillain who randomly thought "I'm gonna gaslight people into thinking 10x4 inventories are normal!"? No! That was only 50% of it!

This mod was the answer to a problem that I noticed, and the answer that this mod provides? It looks simple but it affects the whole game in more ways that you'd imagine!

## The inventory problem

As you might know, the universal constants of all inventories have been pretty much left unchanged since their inception. In fact? Even the mockup carries over the exact same dimensions that modern Minecraft would still carry: 9 columns, 3 rows, with a fourth row exclusive to the player acting as a hotbar. This was perfectly fine in a game that didn't really have a diversity of items and blocks, but on a game that now has thousands of them? The current inventories are no longer suitable.

The reason for that is because at this point? You are capable of doing a whole lot on this game, and yet, the game still asks to manage your inventory carefully, and to plan out what exactly you want to do. If you want to explore? You might have to ignore some of the tasks you wanted to do and come back another day in order to do them. This is perfectly fine! But now the possibilities of what you can do on this game have diversified, you have many different types of stone, wood literally has a whole family now, you many way more ores than you initially had, heck, you can get way more ore per ore than before!

Due to all of that, you can find yourself managing your inventory way more than desired, and well? It was time to have some sort of relief. So, what do I propose?

## Solution: Add a tenth column where applicable

I don't remember exactly why I decided to try out this idea in the first place other than "I felt a little evil during summer break mid-2023 and oh my god i love it! it feels so natural!", but the conclusion was: if you want to do an inventory overhaul in a way that would fit vanilla Minecraft perfectly? You don't do something majorly ridiculous like all those YouTubers keep recommending! You begin with something small!

The idea is simple: what if you changed all nines into tens? Well I changed all correct nines into tens and the result? You have what could be a nice version of the inventory overhaul! It doesn't break anything on the default resolution, it only gives players 4 more slots, and it gives all chests, ender chests, barrels and shulker boxes 3 more slots! While this would look like an unbalanced change? Keep in mind: the maximum slot sizes are the same as before, so this means more unstackables can fit in your chests while you can fit in slightly more loot inside an automated farm for instance.

By adding only a few more slots to the player, exploration should no longer be much of a nuisance thanks to them, and due to only being a small buff? They are still encouraged to not do all tasks in a single go, but rather in many expeditions; However, the need to go back will pop up later than with a smaller inventory, and bundles are still a great complement that can help managing your inventory!

## Alternatives

I'd like to talk about why alternatives to the solution I propose might be riskier or even a bit dangerous compared to it, but for now? I'd rather focus on other stuff for now! I need a break! But stay tuned for an expansion of this doc (hopefully).

## Considerations

Interestingly, by expanding the inventories, the need for Iron Chest mods, where tiered chests are added, might be lessened for the case of Vanilla+! However, if you're dealing with modded Minecraft? Oh boy, be ready to use some sort of storage mod, because those heckers *love* their blocks and items.

A side effect of slightly buffing all sorts of storage blocks, however, was slightly buffing creepers, and while developing the mod, I came to the conclusion that by buffing any sort of storage, you indirectly buff creepers and their capability of Being Pretty Frustrating. Creepers never really felt fair on Vanilla, but something that I realized was that: they were mildly annoying when they destroyed structures, but when they destroyed your chests? That was when it felt like a line was being crossed. It gets even worse on modpacks where they let you create the Omega Chest or whatever! It can feel amazing to have a gigantic screen with all these items inside, but secretly? Creepers were the strongest enemy on your world, they just had to spawn and explode nearby your beloved Omega Chest, and then it's Game Over. My plan to address this problem is to perhaps create a special harness for chests that can protect them against creeper explosions, with them being destroyed after such, but I'll have to think about it.
